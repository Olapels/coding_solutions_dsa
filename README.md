# Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to common problem sets in Data Structures and Algorithms interviews. All solutions are implemented in Python and you can open each directory to see the script.

I write about how I approach each problem on LeetCode. Click the links below to read my solutions:
