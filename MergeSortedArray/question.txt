You are given two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given two integers m and n, representing the number of valid elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Your task is to merge nums2 into nums1 so that nums1 becomes a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The result should not be returned. Instead, it must be stored directly in nums1. To make this possible, nums1 has a total length of m + n. The first m elements of nums1 are the values that should be merged, while the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. The array nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3
After merging, nums1 should become [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6].

Example 2:
nums1 = [1], m = 1
nums2 = [], n = 0
After merging, nums1 should remain [1].

Example 3:
nums1 = [0], m = 0
nums2 = [1], n = 1
After merging, nums1 should become [1].
In this case, nums1 initially contains no valid elements; the zero is only a placeholder to allow the merge.

Constraints:
The length of nums1 is m + n.
The length of nums2 is n.
0 ≤ m, n ≤ 200.
1 ≤ m + n ≤ 200.
Each element in nums1 and nums2 is between −10⁹ and 10⁹ inclusive.
